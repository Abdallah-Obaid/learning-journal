### You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
* rgb values These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(70,50,90)
* hex Codes These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80
* Color names There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan

### `#` To change background color use:-
###### `{background-color: Name of color;}`
### `#` When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible because:-
###### Text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and foreground colors.
###### Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast between background and foreground colors, But if you want people to read a lot of text on your page, however,  then too much contrast can make it harder to read, too.
###### For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability.
### `#` CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to  X indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
### `#` It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast  X between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
### `#` Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
