# Operators and Loops:-
----------------------------------
----------------------------------
----------------------------------
* We use while when we want the client to put the true vale in the prompt>
* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands. 
* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. 
* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false. 
* switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match). 
* Data types can be coerced from one type to another. 
* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy. 
* There are three types of loop: for, while, and do .... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
